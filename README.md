## ⚙️ How It Works

This app uses the **Caesar Cipher**, a simple substitution encryption technique where:
- Each letter is **shifted** by a number of positions (the "key")
- For example:  
  - Key = 3  
  - `A` → `D`, `B` → `E`, …, `Z` → `C`

Decryption reverses this by shifting in the opposite direction.
